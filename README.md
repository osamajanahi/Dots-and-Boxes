# Dots-and-Boxes
Dots and Boxes is a classic paper-and-pencil game that has been brought to the digital realm through a captivating website. The game is played on a grid of dots, where two players take turns drawing a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. When a player completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box, they claim that box and take another turn. The objective is to strategically create boxes and capture as many as possible, while also preventing the opponent from doing the same.
